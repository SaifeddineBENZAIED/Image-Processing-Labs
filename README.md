# Image Processing Labs

This repository contains **three practical labs (TPs)** focused on **image processing techniques**. Each lab explores different aspects of image processing, including **image enhancement**, **denoising**, and **segmentation**. The labs are implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebooks, with a focus on practical applications and quantitative evaluation.

## üöÄ Labs Overview

### 1. **TP2_Image_Enhancement.ipynb**
   - **Objective**: This lab focuses on **image enhancement** based on histogram manipulation, inspired by a scientific article on medical image enhancement.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Read and analyze the scientific article.
     - Implement the described methods for image enhancement.
     - Evaluate and compare results using metrics from the article.
   - **Outcome**: A Jupyter Notebook documenting the methods, results, and comparative analysis.

### 2. **TP3_Image_Denoising.ipynb**
   - **Objective**: This lab explores **image denoising** techniques, including Gaussian noise, salt-and-pepper noise, and the Non-local Means algorithm.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Simulate noisy versions of an original image.
     - Test linear filters (e.g., mean filter, Gaussian filter) and non-linear filters (e.g., median filter).
     - Implement and evaluate the Non-local Means algorithm.
     - Compare results using MSE and PSNR metrics.
   - **Outcome**: A Jupyter Notebook with implemented algorithms, results, and comparative analysis.

### 3. **TP4_Image_Segmentation.ipynb**
   - **Objective**: This lab focuses on **image segmentation** techniques and their evaluation on different image datasets.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Test and evaluate various segmentation methods.
     - Use two performance metrics to compare methods.
     - Analyze results qualitatively and quantitatively.
     - Identify the best-performing method for each image category.
   - **Outcome**: A Jupyter Notebook with segmentation results, performance metrics, and comparative analysis.
